Hackathon Project: Kiln Hackathon (Jan 31 - Feb 2) 🚀

Welcome to our project repository! This code represents the work our team has put together during the Kiln Hackathon, which took place from January 31st to February 2nd. Here's an overview of what we have done and the challenges we faced along the way.

🌟 Project Goals

Our main goal during the hackathon was to create a proof-of-concept application that integrates multiple components:

Frontend Development

We built the frontend using React. This was our first experience with this programming language and framework, making it a challenging but rewarding journey. 🎨

AI Agent Configuration

We attempted to set up and configure an AI Agent that could assist the end user in real-time decision-making.

To make the AI as intelligent as possible, we integrated data from various external APIs:

CoinGecko 📈

DeFiLlama 🦙

Kiln Connect 🔗

Our goal was to feed the agent with the maximum amount of relevant data to provide accurate insights.

We also trained our AI model using the Kiln Connect API, allowing it to better understand and suggest strategies.

ERC-4626 Implementation

We worked on creating the ERC-4626 standard for tokenized vaults.

Although we couldn't implement the full functionality, we outlined the precise mechanism we would have liked to deploy.

Orderbook for vNFT

On our frontend, we created a mock orderbook interface for the vNFT product. While it does not have a backend, it demonstrates how the feature could work with more development time.

Kiln Products

The products we focused on during the hackathon included:

vNFT 🖼️

Kiln Connect 🔗

Kiln DeFi 📉

Kiln Widget 🛠️

✨ Key Features

Frontend Get Started Page:

Designed for user interaction.

Divided into sections for easy navigation.

Allows end users to interact natively with the AI Agent.

AI-Driven Strategy Recommendations:

Based on the user's risk appetite, the AI suggests investment strategies.

These strategies range from conservative to aggressive, leveraging the knowledge and data we embedded into the system.

Orderbook Interface:

Demonstrates how an orderbook for the vNFT product could function, showcasing a potential implementation.

🤔 Challenges We Faced

Learning React:

Since React was new to our team, we had a steep learning curve but managed to implement a functional UI.

AI Integration:

Balancing the data ingestion from multiple APIs and configuring the agent for risk-based strategies proved to be complex.

ERC-4626:

While we successfully wrote the foundation for this standard, implementing it within the given timeframe was not feasible.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend: React ⚛️

APIs: CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, Kiln Connect 🌐

Smart Contracts: Solidity (ERC-4626) 📜

📌 Future Improvements

Fully implement the ERC-4626 mechanism into the system.

Enhance the AI Agent with advanced learning capabilities and dynamic strategy adjustments.

Optimize the frontend for better user experience and interactivity.

Develop a complete backend for the orderbook feature.

👥 Team Acknowledgment

We worked hard as a team, facing challenges head-on and learning from each other. This project is a testament to our determination to create something innovative, even under time constraints.
